We wanted to educate kids about healthy and unhealthy foods. So, we decided to make a game to teach them how to make good choices about food. 

The game starts on a start screen that explains how to play the game. The player has to use WASD to move and the objective of the game is to collect a key, then go to the cage to unlock it and retrieve the good food (apple). There are cookies that travel around the screen randomly and the player has to avoid them while trying to unlock the cage. If they are hit by the cookies, it will take them back to the menu screen.
